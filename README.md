## Instruction set

This CPU assumes 16 bit instructions, in which the first 8 bits will be an instruction and the following 8 bits are its complement.

EE means the instruction's complement and AC is the accumulator register.

| Code  | Description                                |
| ----: | ------------------------------------------ |
|  00   | NOP (no operation)                         |
|  01   | Copy [EE] to [AC]                          |
|  02   | Copy [AC] to address EE                    |
|  03   | Add [EE] to [AC] and store in AC           |
|  04   | Subtract [EE] from [AC] and store in AC    |
|  07   | Read from keyboard and store in address EE |
|  08   | Print [EE]                                 |
|  09   | Stop                                       |
|  0A   | Jump to EE                                 |
|  0B   | Jump to EE if [AC] > 0                     |
|  0D   | Jump to EE if [AC] = 0                     |
